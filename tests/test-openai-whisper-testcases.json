Man säger 70- och 80-tal så var det ju väldigt mycket på torsdagskvällen när man spelade på Krogan. För då var det ju resande ute och dansade och det är ju slut med det idag.",

In the 70's and 80's there was a lot of Thursday nights when you played at the pubs, because then it was traveling and dancing. It's over with that today."

Figure 2 shows that around 30% were happy that Norway had a royal house, and were personally aware of it. 65% thought it was okay with a royal house, without thinking it was particularly important, while only around 5% of those who asked wanted to dismantle the monarchy. This shows that the Norwegian royal house in 1991 had a strong position among Norwegian school students."
